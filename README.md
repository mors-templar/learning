# learning
learning python this is just a collection of all the code written so far
 description of current work done so far 

( project name ) : ( project description )

calculator : learnt how to use built in functions and modular coding 

calculator v2 : learnt how regex works and imported it for validation checks, also expanding upon the use of functions recursilvely 

binary search : a simply binary search algorithm within a array

bubble sort: a simple efficient bubble sort algorithm 

class : first attempt at oop code creation of private class , setters, constructors and getters was achived, get vovlume of box 

class 2 : second attempt at oop code creation of a lengthy code was achived, find employeed details 

inheritence : an attempt at inheritence had problems left for now will revist again later 

insertion sort : a simple insertion sort algorithm 

linear search : a linear search algorithm 

recursion : first attempt at producing an recusrive function, used to find factorial 

recursion q : second attempt at producing an recusrive function , sum of numbers up to a value

recursion q2 : third attempt at recusrsion, count up to 50

random v1 : used random functions and arrays 

random v2 : tried to implement random function with a validation check but didnt work need to do more research and revisit
